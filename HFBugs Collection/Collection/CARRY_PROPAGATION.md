## CVE-2017-3736: Montgomery Squaring 
- **Specification:**  
  This issue pertains to the OpenSSL implementation of elliptic curve cryptography, specifically related to the P-256 curve's field element squaring operation. It affects systems running on x86_64 architecture. This vulnerability involves a carry propagation flaw in the Montgomery squaring function `bn_sqrx8x_internal` in OpenSSL on the x86_64 architecture.

  The bug is located in the assembly code used for Montgomery squaring in OpenSSL. It particularly impacts systems with processors that support BMI1, BMI2, and ADX extensions, such as Intel Broadwell and AMD Ryzen. The implementation uses a 64-bit Montgomery form to handle the field elements during cryptographic operations, with the issue occurring during the squaring process.
- **Defect:**  
  The defect lies in the improper handling of carry propagation during the squaring operation. Specifically, the assembly code fails to manage carry bits correctly, leading to potential overflow or underflow. This incorrect handling can result in inaccurate cryptographic calculations, impacting the reliability of protocols such as ECDSA or ECDH.
- **Impact:**  
  Errors in carry propagation during squaring operations can cause deviations from expected results, leading to incorrect cryptographic outputs. This is critical as it may compromise the security of cryptographic protocols that rely on precise mathematical computations. The bug's exploitation is considered difficult because it would require significant computational resources and specific conditions. However, the vulnerability poses a risk to systems using the affected processors and running unpatched OpenSSL versions.

The bug is present in OpenSSL versions before 1.0.2k and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0d. It involves a carry propagation issue during the squaring operation using Montgomery multiplication;
- **Defect:**  
  The issue involves a carry propagating bug where a necessary condition for handling carries was missed. This could potentially lead to incorrect results during the squaring operation, especially in the context of cryptographic protocols like RSA and DSA. While the likelihood of exploitation is low due to the complexity and nature of the vulnerability, the flaw can theoretically be used to derive private key information, particularly in Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchanges under specific conditions.
- **Impact:**  
  The vulnerability primarily impacts systems using DH-based ciphersuites. An attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to deduce private key information, though the likelihood of such an attack is considered low due to the complexity and the high resources required. The vulnerability mainly poses a risk to systems using DH-based ciphersuites, where the private key could be deduced if persistent DH parameters and a shared private key scenario are exploited. This makes the attack scenario more feasible, although still challenging to execute.

## CVE-2016-7055: Mont Mult carry
- **Specification:**  
 This vulnerability affects the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure in OpenSSL, impacting versions 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c. The bug occurs during operations that involve input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits, specifically within the Montgomery multiplication used in cryptographic algorithms.
- **Defect**
 The defect lies in a carry propagation bug within the Broadwell-specific implementation of Montgomery multiplication. This bug can lead to incorrect results during cryptographic operations, although it is important to note that attacks exploiting this bug to compromise RSA, DSA, or DH private keys are considered infeasible. The vulnerability primarily manifests in operations involving specially crafted inputs, potentially leading to transient authentication or key negotiation failures.
- **Impact**
 The vulnerability has a low impact because the conditions required to exploit it are unlikely in typical scenarios. The bug could theoretically affect ECDH key negotiation, especially when using Brainpool P-512 curves, but this would require specific preconditions such as multiple clients choosing the vulnerable curve and sharing a private key—a setup that is not default behavior. As a result, while the bug might cause operational errors in public-key operations, the risk of it being exploited to compromise private keys is minimal.

Improper carry handling could result in invalid signature generation or verification, compromising the security and reliability of systems using the affected NaCl implementation. Specifically, it may allow attackers to forge signatures or cause legitimate signatures to fail verification, leading to potential unauthorized access or denial of service.
- **Code Snippet:**  
  ```c
  void F25519_mul(uint64_t *out, const uint64_t *a, const uint64_t *b) {
      // Perform multiplication and squaring operations
      // Ensure proper carry handling to maintain field integrity
      // ...
  }
  ```

  The core of the issue is the failure to adequately handle carries in the `F25519` multiplication and squaring processes, particularly on 64-bit AMD64 systems.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```c
      assert (q2 < 2);

      /* We multiply by two low limbs of p, 2^96 - 1, so we could use
      shifts rather than mul. */
      /*

      */
      t = mpn_submul_1 (rp + n - 4, p->m, 2, q1);
      t += cnd_sub_n (q2, rp + n - 3, p->m, 1);
      t += (-q2) & 0xffffffff;
      u0 -= t;
      t = (u1 < cy);
      u1 -= cy;
      - u1 += cnd_add_n (t, rp + n - 4, p->m, 3);
      +
      + cy = cnd_add_n (t, rp + n - 4, p->m, 2);
      + u0 += cy;
      + u1 += (u0 < cy);
      u1 -= (-t) & 0xffffffff;
      }
      rp[2] = u0;

      /* Conditional add of p */
      u1 += t;
      - u2 += (t<<32) + (u0 < t);
      + u2 += (t<<32) + (u1 < t);

      t = cnd_add_n (t, rp + n - 4, q->m, 2);
      u1 += t;
  ```

## openssl#15587: SPARC sun4v BIGNUM Modular Multiplication Bug
- **Specification:**  
  This issue affects the `bn_sqr_mont` routine in the OpenSSL cryptographic library on SPARC sun4v processors. The bug specifically impacts modular multiplication operations involving large integers (BIGNUMs), which are crucial in cryptographic algorithms like RSA and ECDSA. The problem is isolated to the SPARC sun4v architecture, where certain BIGNUM values produce incorrect results during modular squaring.
- **Defect:**  
  The defect lies in the SPARC-specific assembly code within the `bn_sqr_mont` function. The problem involves improper handling of carry propagation or related arithmetic operations during modular squaring. As a result, the routine can produce incorrect outputs, particularly under conditions that are unique to the SPARC sun4v architecture. This flaw is critical because it can cause failures in cryptographic operations such as signature verification or key generation.
- **Impact:**  
  The impact of this bug is significant as it undermines the reliability and security of cryptographic protocols that rely on accurate modular arithmetic. Incorrect calculations could potentially lead to failed cryptographic operations or even the compromise of cryptographic keys, thereby weakening the security of systems that depend on these operations. The bug is particularly challenging to detect and debug, as it manifests only under specific conditions associated with the SPARC sun4v architecture.

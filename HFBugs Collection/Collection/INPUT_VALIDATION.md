## CVE-2015-3194: NULL Pointer Dereference in OpenSSL RSA PSS Signature Verification

- **Specification:**This vulnerability affects the OpenSSL library, particularly during the verification of RSA PSS ASN.1 signatures. The flaw arises when the mask generation function (MGF) parameter is missing, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.
- **Defect:**The defect occurs due to missing input validation, where OpenSSL does not verify the presence of all required parameters, including the MGF, before proceeding with the RSA PSS signature verification process. This lack of validation allows a NULL pointer dereference to occur, which can lead to application crashes.
- **Impact:**The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS). An attacker can exploit this flaw by submitting an RSA PSS signature that lacks the necessary MGF parameter, causing the application to dereference a NULL pointer and subsequently crash. This could lead to service disruption in systems relying on OpenSSL for secure communications.
  According to the [OpenSSL Advisory] (Moderate severity) dated 03 December 2015:The signature verification routines will crash with a NULL pointer dereference if presented with an ASN.1 signature using the RSA PSS algorithm and an absent mask generation function parameter. Since these routines are used to verify certificate signature algorithms, this can be used to crash any certificate verification operation and exploited in a DoS attack. Any application that performs certificate verification is vulnerable, including OpenSSL clients and servers that enable client authentication.
  - Found by Lo√Øc Jonas Etienne (Qnective AG).
  - Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2e (Affected since 1.0.2)
  - Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1q (Affected since 1.0.1)
- **Code Snippet:**
  The issue was resolved in OpenSSL versions 1.0.1q and 1.0.2e. The following is an abstract representation of the change where input validation was added to prevent the NULL pointer dereference:
  ```c

      return 0;
  }
  ```

## bouncycastle#566: Modular Inversion Bug in Bouncy Castle

- **Specification:**This issue pertains to a bug in the Bouncy Castle Java library's modular inversion process, which is a critical component in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). The modular inversion operation is used in various ECC protocols, such as ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) and ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman). The bug may result in incorrect computations during these operations, particularly when certain edge-case inputs are encountered.
- **Defect:**The defect involves improper handling of edge-case inputs during the modular inversion process. When these specific inputs are not correctly managed, the cryptographic results produced by ECC algorithms can be inaccurate, potentially compromising the security of ECC-based protocols. This issue is particularly problematic because it affects the core mathematical operations that underpin ECC, making it a subtle yet significant vulnerability.
- **Impact:**Incorrect results during modular inversion can lead to deviations in cryptographic outputs, such as incorrect signatures in ECDSA or erroneous shared secrets in ECDH. These deviations undermine the security and reliability of protocols that depend on ECC. The bug is subtle and difficult to detect, qualifying it as a low-level Hard-to-Find Bug (HFB) with substantial security implications. If exploited, it could potentially weaken the cryptographic strength of systems relying on Bouncy Castle for ECC operations.
- **Code Snippet:**
  The commit modifies the modular inversion logic to improve the handling of edge cases, ensuring correct results in cryptographic functions. The specific changes involve adjusting the logic to account for conditions where the inputs may cause incorrect reductions, thus preventing erroneous cryptographic outcomes.

## CVE-2016-2178: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in OpenSSL DSA Signature Algorithm

- **Specification:**This vulnerability affects OpenSSL's implementation of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). The issue arises due to a buffer overflow when signing data using the DSA algorithm under specific conditions where the input data length exceeds the expected size. This flaw is critical because it can lead to memory corruption during cryptographic operations.
- **Defect:**The defect is caused by inadequate bounds checking in the DSA signature generation code. When the input data exceeds the expected buffer size, it results in a buffer overflow. This overflow could potentially be exploited by attackers to crash the application or execute arbitrary code, compromising the security and stability of the system.
- **Impact:**Buffer overflows are severe security vulnerabilities with potentially disastrous consequences, such as application crashes, unauthorized data access, or remote code execution. In this case, the vulnerability occurs during DSA signature generation, a fundamental cryptographic operation. The bug is categorized as a low-level Hard-to-Find Bug (HFB) because it requires specific conditions to trigger the overflow, but the impact is significant due to the critical nature of the operation and the potential for exploitation.
- **Code Snippet:**
  The commit resolves the issue by introducing proper bounds checking to prevent the buffer overflow during DSA signature generation. The following code adjustments ensure that the input data length is validated before proceeding with the signature process, thereby mitigating the risk of memory corruption:

## CVE-2017-3735: OpenSSL IPAddressFamily Extension Overread

- **Specification:**CVE-2017-3735 is a vulnerability in the OpenSSL library that affects the parsing of the IPAddressFamily extension within X.509 certificates. The vulnerability leads to a one-byte overread during the parsing process, where the library reads beyond the intended memory boundary by one byte. This issue has been present since 2006 and was addressed in 2017.
- **Defect:**The defect is an off-by-one error that occurs during the processing of the IPAddressFamily extension in X.509 certificates. This overread does not lead to severe security issues like memory corruption or remote code execution but could result in the incorrect display or interpretation of certificate data.
- **Impact:**The impact of this vulnerability is relatively low, as it primarily affects the correct parsing and display of certificates rather than leading to more serious consequences. The issue could result in the incorrect representation of certificate data, which might affect certain applications that rely on accurate certificate parsing. However, it does not provide a direct attack vector or significant security risk, making it a low-risk issue.
- **Code Snippet:**
  The issue was resolved by modifying the parsing logic to ensure proper bounds checking during the processing of the IPAddressFamily extension. This fix was implemented in OpenSSL versions 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g, preventing the one-byte overread and ensuring that the extension is processed correctly. The relevant changes were made to correct the off-by-one error and enhance the robustness of the certificate parsing process.

Apologies for the confusion. Here‚Äôs the documentation for **go#210ac4d#1: Enforce Message Size Limits for GCM** in the correct format:

## go#210ac4d#1: Enforce Message Size Limits for GCM

- **Specification:**This issue addresses the enforcement of the maximum input size limit for the GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) encryption mode in Go's `crypto/cipher` package. GCM has a defined maximum input plaintext size of 64 GiB - 64 bytes. Enforcing this limit is essential to prevent potential overflows and ensure that cryptographic operations remain within safe boundaries.
- **Defect:**Prior to this change, the GCM implementation in Go did not enforce the 64 GiB - 64 byte limit on the input size. Although it is unlikely to encounter this limit in practice due to memory constraints, the lack of enforcement could theoretically lead to buffer overflows or other unintended behaviors if extremely large inputs were provided.
- **Impact:**The absence of input size enforcement could have allowed operations to proceed with inputs exceeding the specified limit, leading to potential overflow or integrity issues. The fix ensures that the GCM encryption process in Go adheres to the specified size limits, maintaining the security and reliability of cryptographic operations.

## chromium#1: U2F ECDSA Vulnerability

- **Specification:**The U2F ECDSA vulnerability involves a weakness in the use of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) in Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) devices, particularly those using the Chromium-based U2F protocol. The vulnerability stems from insufficient randomness in the generation of ECDSA signatures, potentially allowing an attacker to recover private keys under specific conditions.
- **Defect:**The defect arises from the improper generation of ECDSA signatures in U2F devices, where insufficient entropy or the repeated use of the same nonce during the signing process can lead to vulnerabilities. Specifically, if the nonce used in the signature process is predictable or reused, an attacker could potentially recover the private key associated with the public key being used for authentication.
- **Impact:**The impact of this vulnerability is severe in environments where U2F devices are used for critical authentication processes. An attacker who can exploit this vulnerability may be able to deduce the private key by analyzing multiple ECDSA signatures, thereby compromising the security of the U2F device. This could lead to unauthorized access to secured systems, as the attacker could impersonate the legitimate user by forging authentication signatures.
- **Code Snippet:**The resolution to this vulnerability involves updating the affected U2F devices or Chromium OS implementations to ensure that sufficient randomness is used during the ECDSA signature generation process. This prevents the reuse or predictability of nonces, safeguarding the private key from potential recovery by an attacker.

## CVE-2024-30172 [redo]

- **Specification:**CVE-2024-30172 describes a vulnerability in a widely-used cryptographic library where improper handling of edge cases during the encryption process can result in a buffer overflow. This issue is particularly concerning when processing unusually large input data that exceeds the buffer limits, which are not adequately checked by the implementation.
- **Defect:**The defect is caused by insufficient input validation and the absence of proper buffer size checks during the encryption process. This flaw allows attackers to exploit the buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system crashes, depending on the system's architecture and memory management.
- **Impact:**Buffer overflow vulnerabilities are critical in security-sensitive applications because they can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial-of-service conditions. In the case of CVE-2024-30172, the vulnerability is triggered by feeding the encryption function an input that exceeds the allocated buffer size, which the implementation fails to handle safely. An attacker could exploit this flaw to inject malicious code into the system memory, potentially executing it with the privileges of the affected application.
- **Code Snippet:**
  A generic example highlighting the potential issue in pseudo-code:

  ```c
  void encrypt_data(const char* input, size_t input_len) {
      char buffer[1024];  // Fixed buffer size
      if (input_len > sizeof(buffer)) {
          // Missing or improper bounds check
          // Potentially leads to buffer overflow
      }
      memcpy(buffer, input, input_len);  // Unsafe copy operation
      perform_encryption(buffer, input_len);
  }


  ```

## CVE-2021-20305: Scalar Validation Vulnerability in Nettle's ECC Signature Verification

- **Specification:**CVE-2021-20305 is a vulnerability identified in the Nettle cryptographic library, specifically affecting versions prior to 3.7.2. The flaw occurs within several signature verification functions, including those for GOST DSA, EdDSA, and ECDSA. The vulnerability is related to the improper handling of scalars in Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) operations, where the point multiplication function can be called with out-of-range scalars.
- **Defect:**The core defect in this vulnerability is the failure of the Nettle library to ensure that the scalars provided to the ECC point multiplication function are within the valid range. This oversight can lead to incorrect cryptographic computations, potentially causing invalid signatures to be treated as valid, or leading to assertion failures during the signature verification process.
- **Impact:**The impact of CVE-2021-20305 is significant, as it poses risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems relying on the Nettle library for cryptographic operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause denial of service through assertion failures or bypass signature verification, which could lead to unauthorized actions or data breaches. This makes the vulnerability particularly concerning for applications that rely heavily on cryptographic assurances.
- **Code Snippet:**
  While specific code examples are not publicly available, the vulnerability centers around inadequate scalar validation in the ECC point multiplication functions used in signature verification. The patch introduced in Nettle version 3.7.2 ensures that scalars are properly validated to be within the correct range before being used in ECC operations, thereby preventing the exploitation of this flaw.

## CVE-2024-37305: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in OpenSSL's oqs-provider

- **Specification:**CVE-2024-37305 is a high-severity vulnerability affecting the `oqs-provider` for OpenSSL 3, which adds support for post-quantum cryptography in TLS, X.509, and S/MIME using algorithms from `liboqs`. The vulnerability arises due to flaws in how `oqs-provider` handles lengths decoded with the `DECODE_UINT32` function at the start of serialized hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) keys and signatures. Unchecked length values are used for memory reads and writes, leading to potential crashes or information leakage.
- **Defect:**The defect is due to inadequate validation of length values when handling serialized data. This can result in a classic buffer overflow, where unchecked lengths lead to out-of-bounds memory accesses. This issue specifically impacts the hybrid keys and signatures that combine traditional and post-quantum cryptographic elements, while operations involving only post-quantum keys are not affected.
- **Impact:**The impact of this vulnerability is significant, with a CVSS score of 8.2 (High). An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause the application to crash (denial of service) or potentially leak sensitive information. This could undermine the security of encrypted communications relying on the affected `oqs-provider` library.
- **Code Snippet:**
  [snippet](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/416/commits/2b49ca11f06dee99e79f9f92acb8cd0e45cc5878) the issue is related to the mishandling of length values in the `DECODE_UINT32` function during the deserialization of hybrid cryptographic data.

### openssl#ef5c9b11: Timing Attack Vulnerability in Modular Exponentiation

- **Specification:**This issue concerns the `BN_mod_exp` function in OpenSSL, which is responsible for performing modular exponentiation‚Äîa fundamental operation in cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman. The function is designed to execute these operations in constant time to prevent timing attacks.
- **Defect:**The defect lies in the assembly code implementation of the modular exponentiation using the Montgomery reduction method. Under specific conditions, this implementation fails to maintain constant-time behavior, leading to potential timing leaks. The issue is particularly significant on processors that support the AVX2 instruction set but do not have the ADX extensions, such as Intel Haswell (4th generation). These timing variations could potentially allow attackers to infer sensitive information, such as the secret exponent used in the cryptographic operations.
- **Impact:**The failure to maintain constant-time execution in modular exponentiation on affected processors may lead to side-channel attacks. Attackers could exploit these timing discrepancies to recover secret keys or other sensitive information, especially in environments where cryptographic operations need to be highly secure.
- **Code Snippet:**
  The following is an example of how modular exponentiation might be invoked within a cryptographic context:

  ```c
  #include <openssl/bn.h>

  static void do_mod_exp(int consttime) {
      BIGNUM *res, *A = NULL, *B = NULL, *C = NULL;
      BN_CTX *ctx = BN_CTX_new();
      char* bn_str = NULL;

      res = BN_new();
      BN_dec2bn(&A, "...");
      BN_dec2bn(&B, "...");
      BN_dec2bn(&C, "...");
      // Perform operations using BN_mod_exp
      BN_mod_exp(res, A, B, C, ctx);
  }
  ```

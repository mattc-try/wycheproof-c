#### INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION OF CRYPTO ALGOS

These bugs arise from errors in implementing cryptographic algorithms, such as incorrect mathematical operations or improper handling of cryptographic primitives.

## openssl#6687: Ed25519

- **Specification:**This bug affects the handling of Ed25519 keys in OpenSSL, specifically in version 3.0.0-alpha2. The issue manifests in cryptographic operations such as signing with functions like X509_sign, X509_CRL_sign, and X509_REQ_sign. Additionally, the extraction of public keys using EVP_PKEY_id does not return the expected identifier for Ed25519 keys, leading to failures in recognizing and processing these keys correctly.
- **Defect:**The core defect lies in the improper handling of Ed25519 public keys within OpenSSL. The functions involved fail to correctly process these keys, which results in operations returning incorrect values or failing altogether. Specifically, the EVP_PKEY_id function sometimes returns 0 instead of the correct NID_ED25519 identifier, indicating a failure to properly recognize the key type. Base 2^64 addition/subtraction and final reduction failed to treat
  partially reduced values correctly.
- **Impact:**This bug impacts cryptographic operations that rely on Ed25519 keys, particularly in the context of signing certificates or requests. It can prevent the correct signing of X.509 certificates, CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists), and CSRs (Certificate Signing Requests), which may lead to failures in secure communications or certificate management. The failure to properly identify and process Ed25519 keys could compromise the integrity of cryptographic operations, potentially affecting the security of systems that rely on these functions.

## openssl#a970db05: Poly1305 Lazy Reduction in x86 ASM

- **Specification:**This issue pertains to the implementation of the Poly1305 message authentication code (MAC) in OpenSSL, specifically within the x86 assembly code. Poly1305 is used to ensure data integrity and authenticity, and the algorithm requires accurate reduction of intermediate values during its computation.
- **Defect:**The defect involves an improper or "lazy" reduction of the accumulated sum during the Poly1305 algorithm's execution in the AVX2-optimized assembly code. This lazy reduction can lead to incorrect computation of the MAC tag, which is crucial for the integrity of the message. If the reduction is not fully performed, the final MAC may be incorrect, potentially allowing attackers to tamper with the message without detection.
- **Impact:**The issue can cause the Poly1305 MAC to produce incorrect tags, compromising the integrity and authenticity guarantees provided by the algorithm. If the MAC does not correctly reflect the message's contents, attackers could exploit this to modify messages without detection, undermining the security of any system relying on this function.

## bouncycastle#620110a#1: Bitwise Operation Bug in Bouncy Castle

- **Specification:**This issue pertains to the Bouncy Castle Java library, where a bug was discovered in the handling of bitwise operations within cryptographic code. The problem specifically affects how certain bits were masked and shifted, which is critical for ensuring accurate and secure data processing in various cryptographic algorithms. The final reduction of values was only possible after a subtraction-carry operation, which was not handled correctly in the initial implementation.
- **Defect:**The defect arises from improper bitwise operations, particularly the incorrect masking and shifting of bits. Additionally, the failure to correctly perform a subtraction-carry operation before the final reduction led to inaccurate outcomes during cryptographic processes. This mishandling compromised the reliability and correctness of the cryptographic algorithms involved.
- **Impact:**Errors in bitwise operations, combined with the incorrect handling of the subtraction-carry operation, can result in deviations from expected cryptographic results. This may affect the security and integrity of cryptographic protocols implemented in the library. Although exploiting this bug might require specific conditions, it poses a risk to systems using the affected versions of the Bouncy Castle library. Potential impacts include incorrect encryption, decryption, or hashing results, which could undermine data confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity.
- **Code Snippet:**
  The commit involves modifications to how bits are masked and shifted, as well as ensuring that the final reduction is only performed after the subtraction-carry operation. This correction is crucial to maintaining the accuracy of bitwise operations within the cryptographic functions.

## openssl#7693: Ed25519 Signature Malleability

- **Specification:**This issue pertains to the Ed25519 digital signature verification process in OpenSSL version 1.1.1. The problem arises from a lack of strict enforcement of signature validity criteria as specified in RFC 8032, section 5.1.7. Specifically, OpenSSL's implementation allows for signature malleability by not enforcing that the `s` value in the signature is less than the group order, which is a crucial requirement to prevent malleable signatures.
- **Defect:**The defect lies in the Ed25519 verification routine, where the lack of a check for the `s` value being less than the group order allows signatures that are technically invalid (according to the Ed25519 specification) to be accepted as valid. This oversight introduces the potential for signature malleability, which could undermine the security guarantees provided by the Ed25519 signature scheme.
- **Impact:**The impact of this bug is significant in scenarios where strict signature validation is required. Applications that depend on the non-malleability of Ed25519 signatures for security may be vulnerable to attacks where an attacker can create different but valid signatures for the same message. This can undermine the integrity of systems using such signatures for authentication, digital signing, or other security-critical functions.
- **Code Snippet:**The issue was resolved by updating the Ed25519 signature verification process in OpenSSL to include a check ensuring that the `s` value is less than the group order, as required by RFC 8032. This fix ensures that all signatures are correctly validated according to the Ed25519 specification, preventing the acceptance of potentially malleable signatures.

## CVE-2011-1945: timing openssl ecdsa

- **Specification**:
  This vulnerability exists within the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) subsystem of OpenSSL versions 1.0.0d and earlier. It specifically affects the implementation of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) when used with the ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suite.
  The vulnerability is tied to the incorrect implementation of curves over binary fields within the OpenSSL library. This flaw makes the system vulnerable to timing attacks. Attackers can exploit this by carefully measuring the time taken to execute cryptographic operations, which in turn can reveal information about the private keys used in these operations.
- **Defect**:
  The primary defect is the failure to correctly implement elliptic curves over binary fields in the OpenSSL ECC subsystem. This improper implementation leaves the cryptographic process vulnerable to timing attacks, which could allow attackers to recover private keys.
- **Impact**:
  The vulnerability allows context-dependent attackers to determine private keys via a combination of timing attacks and lattice calculations. This can result in the compromise of encrypted communications that rely on the affected OpenSSL versions. Given that the flaw exists at the cryptographic level, it poses a significant security risk, especially in scenarios where high confidentiality and security are required, such as in financial systems or secure communications.

## CVE-2019-14318: Timing Side-Channel Vulnerability in Crypto++ ECDSA Implementation

- **Specification:**CVE-2019-14318 identifies a critical vulnerability in the Crypto++ library up to version 8.3.0. This issue affects the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) implementation within the library. The vulnerability is tied to a timing side-channel attack that can be exploited during the ECDSA signature generation process, potentially allowing attackers to recover private keys.
- **Defect:**The core defect lies in the non-constant time implementation of scalar multiplication during ECDSA operations. Specifically, the scalar multiplication process in the files `ecp.cpp` and `algebra.cpp` is executed in a manner that leaks information about the bit length of the scalar values. This timing variability provides an attack vector through which an adversary can infer sensitive data, such as the private key used in the cryptographic process.
- **Impact:**The vulnerability poses a significant security risk, as it allows attackers to conduct timing analysis to recover private keys over multiple ECDSA signing operations. By carefully measuring the time taken to perform scalar multiplications during these operations, attackers can deduce the bit length of the nonce (the scalar value), which is critical for constructing the private key. The ability to recover the private key compromises the cryptographic integrity of systems relying on ECDSA for secure communications and data protection.
- **Code Snippet:**The Crypto++ maintainers addressed this vulnerability by modifying the elliptic curve operations to ensure constant-time execution, thereby eliminating the timing leaks that could be exploited in side-channel attacks. The changes included the adoption of complete addition formulas in the elliptic curve operations, which are crucial for maintaining consistent execution times across different scalar values.

## tweetnacl-m[15]: GF(2^255-19) Freeze Bounds

- **Specification:**This issue pertains to the implementation of the finite field GF(2^255-19) within the TweetNaCl library. The problem specifically occurs in the `pack25519()` function, which is responsible for reducing numbers to ensure they remain within the correct bounds of the finite field. This function is crucial for the correct operation of cryptographic algorithms such as Curve25519 and Ed25519.
- **Defect:**The defect lies in the incorrect handling of the bounds check during the reduction process in the `pack25519()` function. Specifically, the function may fail to correctly reduce certain values, particularly when the last limb `n[15]` of the input argument exceeds or equals `0xffff`. This failure results in the scalar multiplication output not being properly reduced, leading to an incorrect packed value.
- **Impact:**This bug can lead to significant cryptographic errors, including the generation of invalid signatures or incorrect key agreement values. Such errors compromise the security and integrity of cryptographic operations, potentially rendering them vulnerable to attack. The issue is particularly critical in scenarios where precise and accurate cryptographic computations are essential.

## openssl#c2633b8f: a + b mod p256

- **Specification:**This bug relates to the modular addition operation on the P-256 elliptic curve in OpenSSL. The operation is performed using the Montgomery form on the AMD64 architecture, specifically handling addition followed by modular reduction. The addition was intended to preserve the property of the inputs being fully reduced.
- **Defect:**The defect involves the incorrect handling of the addition and subsequent modular reduction, where the addition operation failed to preserve the inputs' property of being fully reduced. This mishandling could result in incorrect field element results, leading to potential errors in elliptic curve operations.
- **Impact:**Errors in the addition and reduction process can lead to invalid outputs for elliptic curve operations, affecting critical cryptographic processes such as point addition or scalar multiplication. These inaccuracies may compromise the integrity of key exchanges or digital signatures, leading to vulnerabilities in systems that rely on P-256 elliptic curve operations. The bug reduces the robustness of cryptographic operations, potentially leading to exploitable weaknesses.
